# libre

Opinionated CLI for continuous delivery of npm packages.

## Installation

`libre` was already taken on npm so we publish it under `librelibre`.

```
npm install librelibre
```

Then you can access it in your terminal:

```
libre help
```

## Introduction

TODO

For now you can refer to the original issue that specified the overall vision for `libre`: [prisma-labs/issues#2](https://github.com/prisma-labs/issues/issues/2).
